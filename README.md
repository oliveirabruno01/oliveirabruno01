### Hi there, I'm Bruno, an AI and LLMs enjoyeer<!-- 90% enjoyer, 10% engineer -->ðŸ‘‹

Sometimes I do some experiments and <!-- some of the times --> I will publish some of them here, sometimes

## Ideas I'm exploring
- AI-generated playable games
- Game mechanics that only are possible with AI
- ICL (in-context learning) :sparkles:
- Thought Cloning and Alignment Through ICL
- Userless AI
- Everything as a foreign language
- World simulators and no-gradient based optimizations
<!--
## Things that I did and found it cool enough to cite here



## Researches and projects that live rent-free on my mind and on my models' minds
